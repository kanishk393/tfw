Science and Technology Studies (STS) is an interdisciplinary field that emerged in the 1970s. Its
identity is still evolving, but it focuses on understanding the social and cultural aspects of
science and technology. STS practitioners believe that science, technology, knowledge, and
belief are social constructions.
Key Moments in the Emergence of STS:
1. The first publication of Science Studies (later Social Studies of Science) in Edinburgh in 1971.
2. The founding of the Society for Social Studies of Science in 1975.
3. The historical first meeting of the society at Cornell University in 1976.
STS is a hybrid and interdisciplinary field, which means it draws from various disciplines like
history, philosophy, sociology, and more. It resists strict unification and values pluralities and
diversities.
STS Textbooks:
STS textbooks, like this one, aim to provide an introduction to the field. They have unique
chapter outlines and narratives, reflecting the diverse nature of STS.
Central Dogma of STS:
The central dogma of STS is that science, technology, knowledge, and belief are social and
cultural phenomena. STS is grounded in the social sciences.
STS's Approach to Science and Technology:
STS emphasizes that science and technology use tools from the social sciences and humanities
to study, understand, and analyze themselves. It doesn't deny the existence of reality but
challenges the idea of a single, fixed description of reality.
STS Identity:
STS practitioners strive to maintain the hybrid, interdisciplinary, and noncanonical nature of the
field. They value dialogue and diversity within the discipline.
About the Authors:

This text discusses the relationship between technology and society, primarily from the
perspectives of influential social theorists and critics, such as Karl Marx, Lewis Mumford, Ivan
Illich, Jacques Ellul, and Langdon Winner. Here is a summarized version:
**Introduction**
In times of rapid social change, social commentators like Karl Marx, Lewis Mumford, Ivan Illich,
Jacques Ellul, and Langdon Winner have explored the evolving relationship between technology
and society. This analysis aims to explain and evaluate their perspectives.
**Marx's View**
Marx's analysis is rooted in the idea that society is composed of living human individuals. The
physical organization of these individuals forms society, and the production of means of
subsistence arises from this organization. Technology plays a crucial role in self-identifying a
society and can only be created by societies. As societies develop, technology and social
organization become intertwined, shaping social and political relations.
**Complex Relationship**
For Marx, the connection between technology and society is intricate. Technology is not an
isolated entity but part of the means of production that influences social structures, institutions,
ideas, and values. The mode of production and social relations of production drive societal
development and change. As the division of labor intensifies, technology may appear to control
production, individuals, and social change, leading to a sense of alienation. This alienation is a
result of individuals becoming separated from their communities and treated as commodities in
a capitalist system.
**Marx's Solution**
Marx's solution to this problem is to dismantle the division of labor and capitalism, reuniting the
interests of individuals and communities. This reunification, supported by advanced
technologies, would lead to a more humane society where individuals are integrated into their
communities and in control of machines, rather than being controlled by technology and ruling
classes.
In summary, these social theorists and critics offer varying perspectives on the intricate
relationship between technology and society. Marx, in particular, highlights the role of
technology in shaping social organization and the potential for a more humane society through
the proper integration of technology and community.
This passage discusses the perspectives of several social theorists and critics, including Lewis
Mumford, Jacques Ellul, Ivan Illich, and Langdon Winner, on the relationship between
technology and society. Here's a summarized version:
**Lewis Mumford**
Mumford observed that advanced machines existed for centuries before the industrial
revolution. He argued that Western values were compatible with the attributes of machines, but
he questioned whether this accommodation to machines was a surrender. He believed that
machines became a new religion, emphasizing power over others. Mumford emphasized the
need for integrating humanistic values with technology.
**Jacques Ellul**
Ellul focused on how modern humans have become creatures of technological civilization,
driven by "technique." He believed that technique, which integrates machines and society,
becomes inherent in all of us. The presence of technique in societies varies, and it can take on
an autonomous and alienating form in industrial society, seemingly privileging technological
agency over human agency.
**Ivan Illich**
Illich's approach centered on imagining a "convivial society" where tools and technologies have
responsible limits. He distinguished between tools that create demand for what they can do and
complementary enabling tools that support self-actualization. Illich advocated for creating
machines that empower individuals and give them a sense of agency over technology.
**Langdon Winner**
Winner challenged the belief that technologies are autonomous and uncontrollable. He argued
that inventors do not always have precise control over their creations. Winner emphasized that
technologies are not neutral; they promote certain interests while limiting others. He called for
greater social responsibility in technological development and decision-making.
All these authors grappled with the idea of technological determinism, recognizing that
technology is shaped by human needs and interests but also acknowledging the feeling of being
controlled by machines. They emphasized the need for integration, responsible limits, and a
reevaluation of the relationship between technology and society.
This passage delves into the relationship between technology and society, touching on concepts
of power, cultural convergence, and the social construction of technology. Here's a summarized
version:
**Unification and Integration:**
Social critics like Marx, Mumford, and Winner advocate for unification and integration of
technology and society through secular political means. In contrast, Ellul pins his hopes on
religion, while Illich explores the distinction between "working with" and "working for" technology.
**Power in Technology and Society:**
Power is a central theme in these discussions, encompassing agency, influence, control, and
responsibility. Critics argue that humanistic values are often missing from technology, which
tends to prioritize control, order, and domination of nature.
**Technological Determinism:**
Technological determinism, the belief that technology drives social change, is a common myth.
Critics challenge this notion by highlighting the complexity of technological change and the role
of social, cultural, and economic factors in shaping technology's adoption and impact.
**Factors Influencing Technology Adoption:**
Several factors determine whether a technology is adopted or not, including manufacturability,
commercialization, use of infrastructure, and cultural convergence. Cultural values and ideals
can significantly impact the acceptance or rejection of technologies in different societies.
**Working and Social Construction of Technology:**
The "working" of a technology is not solely explained by its technical functioning but is
influenced by social factors. Advocates of the social construction of technology (SCOT) argue
that technology's proliferation is shaped by social explanations and user perceptions.
**Contingency of Technological Change:**
Technological change is highly contingent and not inevitable. The pervasiveness of the
technological determinism myth often leads people to accept changes without questioning them,
despite the complexity and contingency of technological advancements.
This passage emphasizes the need to consider the intricate interplay between technology and
society, debunking the idea of technology as an unstoppable force and highlighting the role of
human values, beliefs, and social factors in shaping technological outcomes.
The passage discusses the concept of the "technological fix," technological determinism, the
role of technology in addressing social problems, and the moral neutrality of technology. Here's
a summarized version:
**Technological Fix:**
The "technological fix" is the belief that introducing more technology can solve social problems.
However, it often overlooks the material and social aspects of these problems. For example,
building walls for personal safety may create privacy but not address the root causes of
criminality.
**Technological Intensification:**
Rather than revolutionary changes, societies often experience technological intensification,
where technologies are adopted to enhance existing social processes. For instance, the car and
telephone emerged to support the rapid urbanization and changing mobility patterns in the early
20th century.
**Moral Neutrality of Technology:**
There is a common misconception that technology is morally neutral, but this overlooks the fact
that technologies come with built-in assumptions, scripts, and values. Technologies can be used
in unexpected ways, and users often rewrite or disobey the intended scripts.
**Affordances and Intentions:**
Affordances are the features designed into a technology to facilitate specific activities. For
example, guns are designed for firing projectiles, reflecting certain values and intentions. While
affordances can be overridden, it requires conscious effort and may go against the technology's
intended use.
**Context Matters:**
The passage emphasizes the importance of considering the intentions of technology designers,
its affordances, cultural meanings, and social relations in assessing whether a technology is
beneficial or problematic. Context is crucial in understanding how technology shapes
interactions and impacts society.
**Actor-Network Theory:**
Actor-network theory highlights how technology becomes part of the context by positioning
material objects as actors with characteristics that influence their use in human interactions.
Overall, the passage encourages a critical examination of technology's role in addressing social
issues, acknowledging its embedded values, and considering the broader social context in
which it operates.
This passage delves into the relationships between technology, power, values, agency, and
identity. Here's a summary:
**Technology's Non-Neutrality:**
The study of technology recognizes that it is not neutral, especially for minority groups.
Technology reflects power dynamics, values, and societal norms.
**Cultural Variability of Technology:**
Technology is created by humans living in societies, and its type, manner, and application vary
across cultures. For example, the stirrup had different effects on Western and Chinese cultures
due to cultural and ecological differences.
**Technology in Art and Identity:**
Mechanical reproduction of art has made it more accessible, but it has also changed the politics
and ideology of art. Technology and social relations are interconnected in the realm of art and
social change. For example, the intimacy between the audience and actor in live theater is lost
in mechanically reproduced theater or movies.
**Computers and Identity:**
The computer's introduction into modern life raises questions about the relationship between
people and machines. Sherry Turkle explores how individuals use computers to create their
identities. Computers evoke changes in mind and self, but these changes are not determined by
computers themselves. Gender differences in computer use are also noted, with men often
being more involved in designing and building computers.
**Technology and Human Essence:**
There is an idea that technology, such as clocks or instruments, can capture elements of natural
phenomena or human essence. Technology can be a means of understanding and capturing
aspects of humankind.
Overall, the passage emphasizes that technology is intertwined with power dynamics, cultural
values, and individual identity, and it highlights the need to consider these factors when
examining the impact of technology on society.
This passage discusses the complex relationship between technology, society, power, and
agency, along with the role of literature and cultural studies in exploring these dynamics. Here's
a summary:
**Mimicking Nature with Technology:**
The passage suggests that humans use technology to better understand themselves, mirroring
elements of nature. This concept is explored through cultural studies of technology.
**Literature and Cultural Studies:**
Literature, art, myth, and narrative converge in cultural studies to examine the evolving
representations of technology, nature, and society. Leo Marx and Langdon Winner use literature
to illustrate ideas related to technology and culture, highlighting the impact of ideology on
society's perspective of technology.
**Identity and Technology:**
Technology plays a significant role in shaping individual identity. People use technology to
produce something that contributes to their sense of self, representing a relationship of
empowerment. However, technology also governs society, suggesting a sense of dominance or
control over individuals.
**Agency and Freedom:**
The concept of agency in the context of technology and society raises questions about freedom.
It's questioned whether having agency over technology is more about political and economic
freedom to influence design and resist imposed technologies. The passage also differentiates
between "power with" (co-agency) and "power over" in relation to technology's influence on
individuals.
**Tools, Work, and Agency:**
The passage discusses how tools and technology can shape the way people work and the roles
they perform. When tools control workers, they are said to have technological agency. Power
dynamics often involve those who control tool-making having authority over those who use the
tools. Tools and machines are seen as social relations, highlighting varying degrees of power
and freedom in technology and society.
In essence, the passage explores the intricate connections between technology, power, agency,
identity, and society, emphasizing the need to consider these factors in understanding the
impact of technology on individuals and cultures.
This passage discusses the concept of cyborgs, the blurring of boundaries between humans
and machines, and the influence of technology on society. Here's a summary:
**Cyborgs and Technology:**
The passage introduces the idea of cyborgs, as proposed by Donna Haraway in her "Cyborg
Manifesto." It suggests that in today's society, humans are already "cyborgs" as they integrate
mechanical artifacts and technology into their identities. Examples include using glasses,
contact lenses, or even experiencing a car as an extension of oneself.
**Fragmented Identities:**
The concept of fragmented identities is discussed, emphasizing the existence of overlapping
social roles and identities. This fragmentation is related to the flexibility of identity in the
postmodern era, where individuals can construct their identities through consumer choices and
online interactions.
**Actor-Network Theory (ANT):**
The passage briefly mentions Actor-Network Theory (ANT), which views technosocial life as a
network of actors, including humans and artifacts, influencing each other. It highlights how
technological systems emerge from relationships among various user scales.
**Power Dynamics and Technology:**
The passage addresses the issue of power in the context of technology and society. It mentions
different viewpoints, from social determinism to technological determinism, regarding how
technology reflects or shapes existing power relations. It also acknowledges that technology can
be both influenced by and subverted by less powerful groups.
**Ambiguity of Cyborgs and Power:**
Cyborgs are seen as ambiguous figures of power. While they offer the illusion of choice and
identity, they are often owned by someone else, raising questions about autonomy and rights.
Power and property are identified as key factors in technological decision-making.
**Risk and Technology:**
The passage discusses the growing concern about risk analysis in technology studies,
especially with the rise of high-risk technologies. It highlights the question of "how safe is safe
enough?" and who gets to decide. Risk assessment is essential at individual, industrial, and
societal levels to address accountability, predictability, and policy implications.
**Complex Systems and Risk:**
Charles Perrow's work on "Normal Accidents" is briefly mentioned, emphasizing the challenges
of controlling complex systems. Tightly coupled systems can lead to unexpected events, and
there is a tension between routinization and operator decision-making. Perrow suggests that
perfect control is elusive, and some complex systems may be inherently risky.
In summary, the passage explores the interplay between humans, technology, power, and risk in
contemporary society, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of these
dynamics.
In this passage, several important concepts related to science, technology, power, and
globalization are discussed. Here's a summary:
**Changing Perceptions of Technology and Community:**
The passage begins by highlighting a shift in perceptions of technology. Initially, increasing
technical control was believed to lead to greater self-knowledge and awareness. However,
technology itself came under scrutiny as a source of danger. The difference is not in the quality
of knowledge but in the kind of community that technology makes possible.
**Risk Analysis and the Human Factor:**
Risk analysis is introduced as a crucial aspect of technology assessment. It emphasizes the role
of the "human factor" both as individuals and within institutional structures. The passage
suggests that risk analysis should consider the influence of power and institutions.
**Fragmented Identities and Systems Thinking:**
The concept of fragmented identities is mentioned, and it's related to systems thinking, which
prioritizes the stability and harmony of the system. Systems thinking requires individuals to
adapt to the system, which characterizes the postmodern world.
**Globalization and the New Global Economy:**
The passage discusses the globalization of the economy, where nations share services, values,
and products defined by technological and scientific cultures. This leads to standardization to
facilitate international exchanges, but it also introduces complexities, such as the term "glocal"
to describe the blend of global and local cultures.
**Information Society and Knowledge Society:**
The passage briefly mentions debates surrounding whether our era is distinct as an "information
society" or a "knowledge society." It suggests readers should be aware of this perspective.
**Science, Technology, and Imperialism:**
Historically, Europeans used their scientific and technological advancements to assert
dominance over other cultures during the era of expansion, colonialism, and imperialism.
Science and technology were seen as measures of a society's worth, and Western superiority
was often declared based on these criteria.
**Different Applications of Science and Technology:**
The passage highlights that the application of science and technology can vary among cultures.
For example, China had advanced technologies before Europe, but cultural values and politics
shaped how these technologies were used. European explorers used science and technology
as sources of power over other cultures, considering them inferior due to differences in scientific
worldviews.
In summary, the passage explores how technology, power, and culture intersect, leading to
changing perceptions and applications of science and technology in different historical contexts
and within the globalized world.
This passage discusses several interconnected themes related to colonialism, science,
technology, power, and cultural narratives. Here's a summary:
**Colonialism and Eurocentric Views:**
European colonialists viewed Africans as being guided by instinct rather than reason, leading to
the belief that it was the responsibility of Westerners to bring Africans into accord with what they
considered rational and civilized modes of thought and behavior. The Europeans used their
science and technology to "civilize" the indigenous cultures, often through force or coercion.
**Shift from Unity to Uniformity:**
The passage highlights the transformation of communities that initially joined together for
freedom and liberation. Over time, the pursuit of unity led to uniformity, and the nation-state
identity shifted to become more bureaucratic. Unity evolved into uniformity, and eventually, the
nation-state identity shifted again to a national security state. Science played a role in this
transformation.
**Science, Violence, and the State:**
The passage explores the relationship between science, violence, and the state. It suggests that
science and technology projects can sometimes result in the loss of civil liberties and have
adverse effects on communities. The state may use science to impose its order on society, and
this can lead to violence.
**Social Triage and Development:**
The concept of social triage is introduced, where certain groups or communities are identified as
dispensable or threatening to the center. Development projects, often based on modern
science, can have negative consequences, leading to more refugees than wars and causing
harm to marginalized groups.
**The Role of Metaphors, Narratives, and Local Knowledge:**
The passage emphasizes the importance of paying attention to local knowledge, narratives, and
metaphors in understanding the relationship between science, power, and culture. Local
knowledge is contrasted with universal or global knowledge, and narratives are seen as a way
to make sense of local events and emergence.
**The Role of Narrative in Science and Technology Studies:**
Narrative is discussed as a tool for exploring and explaining science and technology, both as a
form of discourse and as a way to report on emergent events. This narrative approach is
particularly relevant in the context of local-global discourse.
**The Importance of Diversity and Memory:**
The passage touches upon the idea that science lacks memory, constantly updating itself. It
contrasts this with the metaphor of the seed, which represents memory, past, present, and
future. The passage suggests that embracing diversity and preserving knowledge could be
valuable.
In summary, the passage provides insights into the complex interactions between colonialism,
science, power, and culture, highlighting the consequences of Western attempts to impose their
scientific and technological views on other cultures and the importance of local knowledge and
narratives in understanding these dynamics.
