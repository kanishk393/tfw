This passage reviews several books on the impact of automation and robotics on the future of jobs. The author critically examines the prevailing predictions about the unprecedented job loss due to digital technology, challenging the hyperbole surrounding automation, robotics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The review argues for a more nuanced analysis of the politics of technology and emphasizes the need for a social perspective on futures.

The review begins by summarizing key books in the genre, including "The Rise of the Robots" by Martin Ford, "The Future of the Professions" by Richard Susskind and Daniel Susskind, "The Second Machine Age" by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, and "What Is the Future?" by John Urry.

The books reviewed share a common claim that the current wave of automation, driven by digital technology, is different from previous waves and will lead to unprecedented job displacement. The author challenges this narrative, advocating for a more nuanced analysis and providing critical distance from Silicon Valley's futurist discourse.

The author questions the empirical evidence supporting the claim of massive job loss, particularly Ford's argument that information technology (IT) is a uniquely disruptive force with no historical precedent. The review notes the reliance on vivid stories rather than rigorous data to support these claims. The Oxford Martin School's estimate that half of US jobs are vulnerable to automation is critiqued for its methodology and uncritical proliferation.

The hyperbole surrounding AI is criticized, with the review pointing out the use of anthropomorphic language and the need to focus on political questions related to the dominance of a few corporations rather than the impending robotic revolution.

The review concludes by highlighting the authors' predictions in "The Future of the Professions," which foresee a dramatic transformation of traditional professions due to smart machines and the Internet. The review suggests that a social perspective on technology and a consideration of political questions are crucial for understanding and shaping future developments.

This passage reviews Richard Susskind's perspective on the impact of technology on the legal profession, focusing on his book that envisions a future where most professional advice is delivered by automated IT systems, available for free. The author acknowledges the moral argument for promoting widespread distribution of expert knowledge but raises concerns about the fundamental problem that technologies are only as good as their makers.

The passage critiques the idea that intelligent machines, drawing on vast amounts of data, will make better decisions than human experts. It highlights evidence that machine-learning algorithms, like previous technologies, bear the imprint of their designers and cultural biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes. The review questions the Susskinds' lack of concern about the rise of a powerful elite of Silicon Valley engineers and emphasizes the importance of making the politics of algorithms visible, explicit, and accountable.

The author aligns with Brynjolfsson and McAfee's perspective that the most efficient future involves humans working collaboratively with machines. The review emphasizes the social character of skill and expertise, expressing skepticism about the ability to convey all professional knowledge and experience via online intelligent systems. The passage also critiques the Susskinds' vision of using algorithms for delivering empathetic care in hospitals, pointing out the overlooked emotional work done by para-professionals such as nurses.

While acknowledging the significance of "The Second Machine Age" by Brynjolfsson and McAfee as the best among the reviewed books, the author notes that the authors provide a more balanced account of the pros and cons of automation on work. However, the review criticizes the authors and other reviewed books for not addressing the social issues related to the unequal distribution of work, time, and money in the context of technology development.

The passage concludes by discussing the cultural significance of the current anxiety about automation and the importance of reclaiming the terrain of future studies from a social science perspective. John Urry's reflections in "What Is the Future?" are highlighted, emphasizing the need for social sciences to shape future visions and make the planning process explicit, visible, and accountable.
