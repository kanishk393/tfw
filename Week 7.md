**The Geographically Tethered Model**

*Overview*
The geographically tethered model within the gig economy involves reorganizing existing work processes through digital platforms, focusing on specific locations and times. This chapter explores the unique characteristics of geographically tethered platforms, such as transportation, food delivery, cleaning, and more.

*Spatial and Temporal Constraints*
Geographically tethered work requires specific spatial and temporal proximities, emphasizing the importance of location and timing. Unlike tasks completed solely over the internet, this model cannot be outsourced globally due to inherent geographic constraints and reliance on local infrastructure.

*Worker Engagement and Contractual Outsourcing*
Gig workers in this model are engaged for precise moments needed to complete a task, eliminating the traditional hourly pay model. Contractual outsourcing allows platforms to sidestep organizational obligations, relying on independent contractors for specific task durations.

*Evolution from Traditional Models*
Breaking from traditional ways of organizing work, the geographically tethered model disrupts industries with established norms and regulations. The model's efficiency depends on technology's ability to connect a pool of potential workers to meet demand promptly.

*Intersection of Neoliberalism and Technology*
The growth of the gig economy, facilitated by the geographically tethered model, is attributed to a deregulated environment and advancements in technology. Neoliberalism's influence enables platforms to position themselves as technology companies, reducing employment regulations and attracting excess finance capital.

**The Cloudwork Model**

*Historical Context of Place-Based Work*
Work has historically been place-based, with laborers physically proximate to the object of their labor. The advent of information-based work challenges this relationship, allowing for remote manipulation of information, untethering work from specific locations.

*Digital Transformation of Work*
Digital platforms, particularly cloudwork platforms like Upwork and Freelancer, enable information-based work to be commissioned and carried out from anywhere with an internet connection. This marks a significant shift, allowing for a mass migration of labor without the physical movement of workers.

*Global Distribution of Cloudworkers*
While cloudwork theoretically allows work from anywhere, a global index of online labor platforms reveals a concentration of demand from the US and EU. In contrast, over two-thirds of the world's cloudworkers reside in Asia, with India and Bangladesh hosting a substantial portion.

*Types of Crowdwork: Online Freelancing and Microwork*
Cloudwork encompasses online freelancing, involving longer tasks conducted off-platform, and microwork, comprising short, platform-based tasks with piece-rate compensation. Microwork, epitomized by Amazon Mechanical Turk, involves tasks that leverage human interpretation skills, often cheaper and quicker than AI alternatives.

*Challenges and Implications*
Microwork, a form of outsourcing, challenges traditional notions of work and introduces new economic geographies. The platform-mediated nature of microwork conceals the worker, and tasks performed by microworkers contribute to the automation of machine learning systems, potentially replacing the very workers who train them.

The text you provided explores two major models of gig economy platforms: geographically tethered platforms and cloudwork platforms. Let me summarize the key points:

**Geographically Tethered Model:**
- This model involves existing forms of work reorganized through a digital platform, such as transportation, food delivery, cleaning, care, laundry, and pet services.
- Geographically tethered work requires specific spatial proximities and temporal synchronicities; it needs to happen in a particular place and time.
- This model relies on smartphone apps to organize both the worker and the customer, providing a new way to organize work.
- Workers are engaged for precise slivers of time required to complete a task, relying on contractual outsourcing that sidesteps traditional worker protections and benefits.
- The growth of the gig economy in this model is facilitated by changes in political economy, creating a deregulated environment where platforms position themselves as technology companies.
- The use of algorithmic management keeps costs low, providing effective management for a geographically dispersed and scalable workforce.

**Cloudwork Model:**
- Work becomes untethered from a specific location, allowing it to be done by anyone, from anywhere, with the right technological affordances.
- Online freelancing and microwork are key components of the cloudwork model, involving tasks like software development, web design, transcription, data collection, and content moderation.
- Platforms like Upwork and Freelancer enable workers to set their own rates and work from anywhere with an internet connection.
- There's a global distribution of workers on cloudwork platforms, with a significant number in Asia, particularly in India and Bangladesh.
- Microwork involves completing short tasks on a platform interface, often related to image identification, transcription, annotation, and content moderation.
- Cloudwork has lower spatial control, allowing workers to have high spatial autonomy and work from diverse locations.
- The cloudwork model has a lower level of explicit coordination and power asymmetry compared to geographically tethered platforms.

**Understanding How Platforms Work:**
- Uber is presented as an example of a geographically tethered platform that manages the supply and demand of labor.
- The chapter introduces a table (Table 1) assessing the relationship between spatial control, temporal control, ability to set pay rates, task discretion, digital legibility, barriers to entry, complexity of labor process, and degree of explicit coordination and power asymmetry in the gig economy.
- Factors such as spatial control, temporal control, ability to set pay rates, digital legibility, and barriers to entry differ between geographically tethered and cloudwork platforms.
- The degree of explicit coordination is high in geographically tethered platforms, while cloudwork platforms tend to have less explicit coordination over the labor process.
