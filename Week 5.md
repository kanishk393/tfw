The passage discusses the historical development of scientific management, often referred to as Taylorism, as a management approach within capitalist enterprises. Here's a structured summary of the key points:

1. **Origins in Classical Economics**: The passage begins by highlighting that the classical economists were the first to approach labor organization within capitalist production theoretically. They can be considered the earliest management experts.

2. **Gap and Growth in Enterprises**: A gap of over half a century existed between the classical economists and the comprehensive formulation of management theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During this time, enterprises grew in size, monopolistic organization emerged, and science was applied systematically to production.

3. **Introduction of Scientific Management**: Frederick Winslow Taylor initiated the scientific management movement in the late 19th century, influenced by the changing dynamics of capitalist enterprises. Taylorism aimed to apply scientific methods to control labor in growing capitalist businesses.

4. **Capitalist Perspective**: Scientific management, as described, is rooted in the capitalist perspective of production. It starts from the viewpoint of managing a workforce within antagonistic social relations and accepts these conditions as natural. It is not concerned with discovering the underlying causes of these conditions.

5. **Focus on Labor Adaptation to Capital**: Taylorism's primary focus is on adapting labor to meet the needs of capital, rather than examining labor in a broader sense.

6. **Not a True Science**: While it claims to apply scientific methods, scientific management lacks the characteristics of a true science. It enters the workplace as a representative of management, masquerading as a science.

7. **Universal Application of Taylorism**: Taylorism's principles are applied universally to various forms and stages of work, regardless of the nature of technology employed. It's concerned with the organization of labor processes.

8. **Taylorism's Ongoing Influence**: The passage emphasizes that Taylorism is not outdated or superseded. While it may not exist as a separate school today, its principles are deeply ingrained in work design and continue to shape modern corporations.

9. **Shift from Taylorism to Personnel Management**: The later schools of industrial psychology and human relations, such as those of Hugo MÃ¼nsterberg and Elton Mayo, shifted the focus from labor process organization to the worker's adjustment to that process. These later schools often operate in personnel departments and academia.

10. **Scientific Management's Enduring Impact**: Scientific Management remains focused on the organization of work itself. It involves the systematic study and improvement of work processes and performance.

11. **Historical Background**: The passage also provides historical context by mentioning early attempts at the scientific study of work, including references to classical economists and figures like Charles Babbage and Henri Fayol.

12. **Taylor as Culmination**: Taylor is seen as the culmination of a trend that had been developing throughout the 19th century, providing a coherent philosophy and framework for the management of labor and production.

In summary, the passage discusses the emergence of scientific management (Taylorism) in the late 19th century as a management approach rooted in the capitalist perspective, its ongoing influence in modern corporations, and its historical context within the broader development of management theory.

This passage discusses two key aspects of Frederick Winslow Taylor's approach to scientific management:

1. **Taylor's Approach to Scientific Management**:
   - Taylor is distinguished from physiologists and psychologists who studied human capacities for scientific interest. His records and estimates were crude, making it easy for critics like Georges Friedmann to question his experiments, which were often more about demonstrating control than scientific inquiry.
   - Taylorism is not a "science of work" in the general sense but a science of managing others' work in a capitalist context. It aims to control alienated labor within the capitalist system.

2. **Taylor's Concept of Control**:
   - Taylor emphasized the concept of control in management, taking it to unprecedented levels. Traditional management control involved dictating the length of the working day, supervision, and rules to ensure diligence. However, Taylor's contribution was to dictate the precise manner in which work should be performed.
   - He believed that management needed to control every aspect of labor activity, from the simplest to the most complicated, to achieve efficiency.
   - Taylor's approach led to a significant revolution in the division of labor, advocating strict control over the worker's mode of performing tasks.

3. **Taylor's Background and Personality**:
   - Taylor came from a well-to-do Philadelphia family but chose a craft apprenticeship over his family's expectations of pursuing law.
   - His personality was described as obsessive-compulsive, with a focus on efficiency from a young age, which suited him well for his role as a proponent of capitalist management.

4. **Struggle with Workers**:
   - Taylor's experiences as a gang boss at the Midvale Steel Works involved a classic struggle between management and workers over piecework rates and output.
   - Workers limited their output due to piecework incentives, leading to a conflict when Taylor sought to increase production.
   - This struggle was reflective of the broader antagonistic relations between management and labor in the workplace.

5. **Taylor's Influence Beyond the U.S. and Britain**:
   - Taylor's approach gained popularity not only in the United States and Britain but also in other industrial countries, including France (l'organisation scientifique du travail) and Germany (rationalization).
   - German corporations were early adopters of Taylorism even before World War I.

6. **Taylor's Perspective and the Role of Control**:
   - Taylor's perspective, rooted in capitalism, sought to maximize control over labor to achieve efficiency and productivity.
   - He believed that workers needed precise instructions on how to perform tasks, representing a fundamental shift in the management of labor.

Overall, the passage sheds light on Taylor's unique approach to scientific management, his emphasis on control, and the historical context in which his ideas gained prominence. It also highlights the ongoing relevance of Taylor's principles in modern industrial management.

In this part of the passage, Frederick Winslow Taylor describes his struggles and confrontations with workers in the context of his efforts to increase productivity in the machine shops. Here are the key points:

1. **Conflict Between Management and Workers**:
   - Taylor, in his role as a gang boss, confronted significant resistance from the workers when he attempted to increase productivity.
   - He explained the situation to the management, predicting that the workers would challenge his competence and truthfulness.

2. **Taylor's Initial Attempts**:
   - Taylor began his efforts to boost productivity by instructing a worker to increase their output. When the worker failed to do so, Taylor personally demonstrated that it could be done.
   - Despite Taylor's efforts, the worker maintained the same output and refused to adopt better methods, leading to his replacement.

3. **Shift to New Workers**:
   - Taylor then sought out intelligent laborers without formal trade training and taught them how to run a lathe efficiently.
   - These laborers initially promised to work at an increased pace once they learned the trade, but when they did learn, they joined other workers in resisting higher productivity.

4. **Taylor's Response**:
   - Taylor acknowledged the challenging social pressure put on these laborers from outside the workplace.
   - He confronted the laborers and reminded them of their broken promises, expressing a lack of mercy.
   - Taylor decided to reduce the pay rate for these laborers by half, making it conditional on them producing a fair day's work.

Overall, this portion of the passage illustrates the intense conflict between Taylor, representing management's drive for increased productivity, and the workers who resisted these changes due to social pressure and their perceptions of their interests as machinists. Taylor's response involved taking decisive measures to enforce productivity standards, even if it meant reducing wages for certain workers.

**Summary of Frederick W. Taylor's scientific management**

**Introduction**

Frederick W. Taylor's scientific management system is a management philosophy that aims to improve the efficiency of production processes by observing and analyzing the work of individual workers. Taylor believed that there was an optimal way to perform each task, and that workers could be trained to achieve this level of output without injury to their health.

**Principles**

The four principles of scientific management are:

1. **Develop a science for each element of work.** This involves observing and analyzing work tasks to identify the most efficient way to perform them.
2. **Scientifically select, train, teach, and develop the worker.** This involves selecting the right worker for the job and providing them with the training and support they need to be successful.
3. **Cooperate with the worker.** This involves working with the worker to ensure that they understand and support the scientific management system.
4. **Divide the work almost equally between the management and the workers.** This means that management should take responsibility for tasks such as planning and scheduling, while workers should focus on performing the tasks themselves.

**Opposition**

Taylor's scientific management system was opposed by many workers, who felt that it was exploitative and unfair. Workers argued that the system was too rigid and that it did not give them enough autonomy. They also argued that the system was designed to benefit management at the expense of workers.

**Conclusion**

Taylor's scientific management system had a significant impact on the development of modern management practices. However, its legacy is complex and controversial. The system was criticized for its dehumanizing treatment of workers, but it also led to significant improvements in productivity and efficiency.

**Brief summary in a well-structured manner**

Frederick W. Taylor's scientific management system is a management philosophy that aims to improve the efficiency of production processes. The system is based on four principles: developing a science for each element of work, scientifically selecting, training, teaching, and developing the worker, cooperating with the worker, and dividing the work almost equally between the management and the workers.

Taylor's system was opposed by many workers, who felt that it was exploitative and unfair. However, the system also had a significant impact on the development of modern management practices.

This part of the passage discusses Frederick Winslow Taylor's observations and conclusions regarding the practice of systematic soldiering among workers and its implications for management. Here are the key points:

1. **Systematic Soldiering Defined**:
   - Systematic soldiering refers to the deliberate practice of workers slowing down their pace of work with the aim of keeping their employers ignorant of how fast the work can actually be done.

2. **Widespread Practice**:
   - Taylor suggests that systematic soldiering is a universal phenomenon in large establishments. It is prevalent among both day laborers and those working under various compensation systems, including piecework and contract work.

3. **Reasons for Systematic Soldiering**:
   - Workers engage in systematic soldiering primarily because employers set a maximum earning limit for each class of employees, regardless of productivity.
   - Pay rates for labor are socially determined and relatively independent of individual productivity.
   - Workers realize that even if they produce more, their pay increases only incrementally and may be eliminated as higher productivity becomes the norm.
   - Taylor notes that piecework systems, in particular, intensify the practice of systematic soldiering. When workers experience pay cuts after increasing output, they become determined to resist further reductions.

4. **Taylor's View on Workers' Rationality**:
   - Taylor believed that workers engaged in systematic soldiering were acting rationally in their own best interests.
   - He acknowledged that workers were right to resist increasing their output because under piecework systems, they would not necessarily earn more wages for their efforts.

5. **Management's Need for Control**:
   - Taylor's conclusions from his experiences at Midvale emphasized the need for management to have control over the labor process.
   - He argued that control over the labor process should not be just a formal authority but should extend to dictating every step of the process, including how the work is performed.

6. **Efforts and Costs of Control**:
   - Taylor believed that the efforts and expenses required to gain control over the labor process would be repaid by the increased productivity and efficiency it would yield.

7. **Critique of Later Industrial Sociology**:
   - Taylor criticized later industrial sociologists who characterized workers' refusal to increase output as "irrational" or "noneconomic" behavior.
   - He argued that such characterizations failed to recognize the rationality of workers' concerns and fears regarding wages and job security.

8. **Workers' Rationality in Economic Terms**:
   - William M. Leiserson, an economist, supported the notion of workers' rationality in limiting output when wages were increasing, comparing it to business practices where production is curtailed when prices fall or wages are cut when labor efficiency increases.

Overall, this section highlights the practice of systematic soldiering among workers, its rational basis, and its impact on management's need for control over the labor process. It also critiques later interpretations of worker behavior by industrial sociologists and emphasizes the economic rationality of workers' actions in response to changing economic conditions.

This passage discusses Frederick Winslow Taylor's application of scientific management principles in a specific case involving the handling of pig iron at the Bethlehem Steel Company. Here are the key points from the passage:

1. **Introduction to the Case**:
   - The passage begins by explaining that one of Taylor's early applications of scientific management principles was at the Bethlehem Steel Company in handling pig iron.

2. **Challenges with Existing Work Practices**:
   - Initially, the workers at the Bethlehem Steel Company, consisting of about 75 men, were tasked with loading pig iron onto railcars from small piles in an open field.
   - These workers, who were considered good and worked under an excellent foreman, were loading an average of about 12Â½ long tons of pig iron per man per day.

3. **Setting New Productivity Goals**:
   - Taylor and his team studied the work and determined that a first-class pig-iron handler should be able to handle between 47 and 48 long tons per day.
   - They were initially surprised by this finding but were confident in their assessment of the proper work pace.

4. **Managerial Duties**:
   - It became the duty of the management, under the principles of scientific management, to ensure that the 80,000 tons of pig iron were loaded onto railcars at the rate of 47 tons per man per day, as opposed to the existing rate of 12Â½ tons.
   - The management aimed to achieve this without causing strikes or conflicts among the workers and while ensuring the workers were happier and more content.

5. **Scientific Selection of Workmen**:
   - Taylor emphasized the importance of selecting the right workmen for the task. Each worker's abilities, limitations, and personal characteristics were taken into account.
   - Taylor's team carefully observed and studied the 75 workers over several days to select the initial candidate for the improved work pace.
   - They chose a worker named Schmidt, described as a Pennsylvania Dutchman who was physically fit, hardworking, and thrifty. Schmidt was diligent in his savings and was in the process of building his own house.

This passage illustrates how Taylor applied scientific management principles to optimize work processes. It emphasizes the importance of selecting the right workers and setting specific, scientifically determined productivity goals. Taylor's approach aimed to increase efficiency, enhance worker satisfaction, and achieve higher productivity without causing labor disputes.

This passage continues to describe Frederick Winslow Taylor's approach to scientific management, focusing on the case of Schmidt and the handling of pig iron at the Bethlehem Steel Company. Here are the key points from this portion of the passage:

1. **The Challenge**:
   - The challenge for Taylor and his team was to make Schmidt, an average worker, handle 47 tons of pig iron per day while ensuring he was content with this task.

2. **Engaging with Schmidt**:
   - Taylor engaged with Schmidt in a conversation to determine whether he considered himself a "high-priced man" who wanted to earn $1.85 a day as opposed to the standard $1.15 per day.

3. **Setting Expectations**:
   - Taylor emphasized that being a high-priced man was not just about desiring higher wages but also about adhering strictly to instructions and not talking back.

4. **The Work Process**:
   - Schmidt was assigned to load pig iron onto railcars under close supervision, following a specific routine dictated by a man with a watch.
   - He was told when to pick up a pig, walk, sit down, and rest throughout the workday.

5. **Positive Outcomes**:
   - Schmidt consistently worked at the required pace and successfully handled 47Â½ tons of pig iron per day.
   - He averaged more than $1.85 per day, a 60 percent increase in wages compared to the standard rate.
   - Other workers were also selected and trained to achieve the same level of productivity, ultimately earning higher wages than their peers.

6. **The Selection of Workers**:
   - Taylor emphasized that the key to success was not finding extraordinary individuals but rather selecting ordinary workers who were physically suited to the task.
   - The physical ability to perform the work, rather than exceptional skills or intelligence, was the primary criterion for selection.

7. **Taylor's Critique of Bell's Misinterpretation**:
   - The passage critiques Daniel Bell's interpretation of Taylor's work, particularly in the case of handling pig iron, highlighting discrepancies and misunderstandings in academic descriptions of work processes.

8. **Rate Cutting Under Scientific Management**:
   - Robert F. Hoxie's study on scientific management pointed out that rate cutting often occurred indirectly, such as through the creation of new job classifications at lower pay rates.

9. **Selection of Workers for the Task**:
   - In the case of pig-iron handling, only about one in eight workers were physically capable of handling 47Â½ tons per day.
   - The selection process involved identifying workers who were well-suited to the specific task, rather than seeking extraordinary individuals.

This passage underscores Taylor's systematic approach to increasing productivity and wages through scientific management, highlighting the importance of selecting the right workers for specific tasks and setting clear expectations for performance. It also critiques academic misinterpretations of Taylor's work.

In this passage, the text discusses Frederick Winslow Taylor's approach to scientific management and the principles he applied to various tasks, particularly in machine shops. Here are the key points from this portion of the passage:

1. **Taylor's Focus on Control**:
   - Taylor spent his career expounding and applying principles of control in various industries and tasks.
   - He believed that his principles of control could be applied to both simple and complex forms of labor.

2. **Historical Perspective on Craftsmanship**:
   - Before the Industrial Revolution, skilled crafts or trades were the fundamental units of the labor process.
   - Skilled workers were masters of traditional knowledge, responsible for making decisions related to their craft.

3. **Craftsmen as Masters of Knowledge**:
   - Craftsmen possessed extensive knowledge of materials, techniques, and processes related to their trade.
   - Each craftsman represented a branch of the division of labor and held the accumulated knowledge of that branch.

4. **Examples of Traditional Crafts**:
   - Various traditional crafts included pottery, tanning, blacksmithing, weaving, carpentry, baking, milling, glassmaking, cobbling, and farming.
   - Farming was a significant and widespread craft, often combining multiple other trades within a farming family.

5. **Lengthy Apprenticeships**:
   - Apprenticeships in traditional crafts typically lasted from three to seven years, sometimes extending into the journeyman years.
   - Learning processes involved acquiring knowledge and skills.

6. **The Emergence of the Machinist's Trade**:
   - The machinist's trade was one of the most recent and important additions to modern industry during Taylor's time.
   - Taylor focused on controlling labor in this complex trade.

7. **Taylor's Focus on Labor Control**:
   - Taylor was primarily concerned with labor control rather than technological advancement.
   - He conducted experiments, collected data, and systematized knowledge related to machine-shop practices.

8. **Complexity of Machine-Shop Work**:
   - Machinists had to make numerous decisions during the machining process, including various variables such as materials, tooling, and machining parameters.
   - The range of possible choices in machine-shop work was vast, posing a significant challenge for management.

9. **Taylor's Experiments**:
   - Taylor conducted extensive experiments at the Midvale Steel Company, spanning 26 years and involving tens of thousands of tests.
   - His goal was to determine the optimal combinations of choices for each step in the machining process.

10. **Slide Rule for Decision-Making**:
	- Taylor developed a "slide rule" based on experimental data to guide machinists in making decisions during the machining process.
	- Machinists were required to follow instructions derived from this tool, shifting away from relying on their own knowledge and experience.

11. **Taylor's Principles**:
	- Taylor's principles included the gathering of traditional knowledge, systematizing it into rules and formulas, and dissociating the labor process from workers' skills.
	- He emphasized the removal of brain work from the shop and centralizing it in planning departments.

This passage underscores Taylor's emphasis on controlling labor processes, standardizing decision-making, and reducing dependence on workers' individual skills and knowledge. Taylor's scientific management principles aimed to place control in the hands of management rather than craftsmen, changing the dynamics of work in industrial settings.

This passage discusses several important principles of scientific management, as proposed by Frederick Winslow Taylor. Here are the key points from this portion of the text:

1. **Combination of Execution and Conception in Human Labor**:
   - The essential feature that distinguishes human labor from animal labor is the ability to combine execution with the conception of the task to be performed.

2. **Dehumanization of the Labor Process**:
   - In the context of social labor, the separation of conception from execution becomes possible.
   - This separation is essential for managing purchased labor, allowing management to dictate methods and pace.

3. **Principle of Separation of Conception from Execution**:
   - This principle involves divorcing the mental aspect (conception) of work from the physical aspect (execution) to facilitate control.
   - It applies not only to manual labor but also to mental labor, leading to the separation of mental and manual labor.

4. **Development of Work Science by Management**:
   - Taylor argued that the development of a science of work should be the responsibility of management, not the worker.
   - He suggested that it was impractical for workers to engage in scientific studies of work processes due to time and financial constraints.

5. **Ownership of Knowledge**:
   - Taylor asserted that knowledge derived from the study of work should belong to management, as they invest resources in such studies.
   - He claimed that workers, even if intellectually capable, would keep any improvements to themselves, adhering to the concept of trade secrets.

6. **Workers as Part of Capital**:
   - Taylor's argument implied that labor itself had become a part of capital, emphasizing the capitalist's control over both the means of production and the labor process.

7. **Separation of Conception and Execution as Capital's Interest**:
   - Taylor believed that separating conception from execution was in the interest of capital.
   - He suggested that improvements in work methods by workers brought limited benefits to management.

8. **Cheapening Labor**:
   - Taylor's goal was to cheapen labor by decreasing worker training and increasing output.
   - He sought to replace skilled workers with less skilled and cheaper labor.

9. **Task-Oriented Management**:
   - Taylor introduced the concept of the "task idea" in scientific management.
   - Under scientific management, each worker's task is fully planned by management, including detailed instructions on what and how to do the work, along with the allotted time.

10. **Detailed Work Instructions**:
	- Workers receive written instructions describing their tasks, means of execution, and the time frame for completion.
	- Scientific management revolves around preparing and enforcing these tasks.

These principles reflect Taylor's approach to scientific management, which aimed to maximize control over labor processes, standardize tasks, and increase managerial authority over work methods and execution. Taylor's ideas had a significant impact on industrial practices in the early 20th century and laid the foundation for modern work management systems.

In this passage, the text discusses the third principle of scientific management proposed by Frederick Winslow Taylor. Here are the key points from this portion of the text:

1. **Importance of Systematic Pre-Planning**:
   - The critical element in this principle is not the written instruction card but rather the systematic pre-planning and pre-calculation of all elements of the labor process.
   - The labor process is no longer conceived by the worker but by a specialized management staff.

2. **Monopoly of Knowledge by Management**:
   - Management holds a monopoly over knowledge related to labor processes, ensuring that workers lack this knowledge.
   - Workers are excluded from understanding the processes they are engaged in.

3. **Simplified and Repetitive Work Tasks**:
   - Over time, as work tasks became simplified and repetitious, the need for written instruction cards diminished.
   - Nevertheless, the concept of management's direct control over the labor process remained.

4. **Instruction Card as a Producer of Predetermined Product**:
   - Lillian Gilbreth's definition of the instruction card is mentioned, highlighting how it transforms the worker into a mediating instrument.
   - Management becomes the producer, dictating plans and instructions to bring the product into existence.

5. **Worker's Learning from Task Card**:
   - Alfred Marshall's notion that workers could learn how production is carried out from task cards is briefly discussed.
   - This concept implies that workers, having relinquished craft knowledge, should gain complex technical knowledge from their task cards.

6. **Shift in Worker-Manager Relations**:
   - Taylor's approach necessitated a psychological shift in the relationship between workers and managers.
   - Workers who were accustomed to autonomy in their work had to adapt to closely governed instructions.

7. **Role of Foremen**:
   - Foremen played a crucial role in enforcing management's control over the labor process, ensuring that workers followed instructions exactly.

8. **Emergence of Modern Management**:
   - Modern management emerged as a theoretical construct and systematic practice during a period when the transformation of labor from skill-based processes to science-based processes was accelerating.
   - Its role was to make explicit and systematic the implicit tendencies of capitalist production.

9. **Worker's Transition to General Labor Power**:
   - As craft-based work declined, workers transitioned to becoming general and undifferentiated labor power, adaptable to various simple tasks.
   - Meanwhile, scientific knowledge and control concentrated in the hands of management.

10. **Bureaucratization of Work**:
	- The text suggests that the shift in worker-manager relations, characterized by the concentration of control in management, is not limited to the past.
	- It continues to occur as new occupations emerge, are routinized, and subjected to management control, particularly in office, technical, and educated occupations.
	- This process is sometimes referred to as "bureaucratization," although the text notes that it is better understood as a product of capitalist organization of work rather than simply a feature of large-scale or complex enterprises.

This passage illustrates how Taylor's principles aimed to centralize control over labor processes in the hands of management, with detailed planning and instructions, while reducing the autonomy and skill of the worker. It also discusses the enduring nature of this shift in worker-manager relations across various occupations and industries.
