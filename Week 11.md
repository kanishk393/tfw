This text introduces the concept of futures and explores the significance of anticipating, visualizing, and understanding the future in various domains of human activity. It highlights the paradox of the future being both essential for decision-making and yet unpredictable and uncertain. The author emphasizes the prevalence of futures thinking in organizations, institutions, and societies, and the impact of these anticipatory efforts on shaping the present.

The text discusses the diverse methods used to envisage potential futures, including scenario planning, literary and artistic depictions, and technological advancements. It mentions influential figures and organizations, such as Hermann Kahn, Google, Shell, the IPCC, and military institutions, actively engaged in developing future-oriented discourses and techniques.

There is a recognition of the accelerating pace of change, as analyzed by Toffler's "Future Shock" and the impact of exponential technological and social transformations. The concept of "Moore's Law" is introduced, highlighting the doubling of world computing power every two years, leading to the rapid evolution of technology.

The notion that the future might be disappearing or transforming into an "extended present" is explored, and the challenges faced by individuals, especially during times of austerity, are discussed. Financial products based on high-frequency trading are mentioned, illustrating the difficulty of grasping futures in an accelerating world.

The contested nature of futures is emphasized, with conflicting social interests and the need for inter-generational perspectives. The environmental movement's role in advocating for the interests of future generations is highlighted, referencing the Brundtland Commission's Report on Our Common Future. The text also notes the challenges faced by future generations in having a voice in societal decisions and policies.

The concept of the "parliament of generations" is introduced, questioning the power dynamics between current and future generations. Instances of generational solidarity, such as the environmental movement in 1970, are discussed as transformative moments when the long-term future became a powerful structure of feeling.

Finally, the text suggests an orientation towards democratizing futures, advocating for more inclusive and participatory approaches to shaping the future. The importance of efforts to bridge generational gaps and create "imagined communities" that consider a common future is emphasized.

The text discusses the reluctance of social science to engage with the concept of futures, despite the prevalence of social conflicts related to different visions of the future. The historical context is highlighted, pointing out that social science made a limited contribution to theorizing and analyzing futures. Notable exceptions are mentioned, such as the works of Bell and Wau (1971) and Young (1968).

The reluctance of social science to delve into futures is attributed, in part, to the perceived failure of Marxist predictions regarding global revolution led by the industrial working class. The text explores Marx's expectation of a proletarian revolution and how it did not materialize as predicted. However, it acknowledges that Marx's earlier writings recognized the uncertainty and unpredictability inherent in capitalist societies, discouraging the development of specific blueprints for the future.

The rejection of social science involvement in predicting or planning the future is linked to the critique of utopian imagining, especially during the Cold War period. The text notes that social science turned away from developing and analyzing possible futures, with only a few, like Lefebvre, Bauman, and Olin Wright, arguing for the power of utopias to reveal limitations of the present.

The emergence of studies on alternative futures is discussed, emphasizing that they mainly developed outside the realm of traditional social science. Future studies is portrayed as a specialized and professionalized discipline, separate from mainstream social science. The development of futurist thinking, particularly after 1945, is linked to Cold War debates and military and corporate agendas.

Futures work is also attributed to the environmental movement's growing significance after 1970. The Limits to Growth debates and the 1973 oil crisis are highlighted as influential factors leading to the development of computer models predicting various future scenarios, both pessimistic and optimistic. The text mentions the role of General Circulation Models in simulating the consequences of increasing CO2 levels on global climate, with these predictions being incorporated into reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

In summary, the text provides insights into the historical development of futures thinking, the reluctance of social science to engage with it, and the emergence of specialized disciplines and studies focused on anticipating and analyzing alternative futures.

This section of the text argues for the importance of integrating the study of futures into social science and emphasizes the significant impact that different social futures can have on people's lives in the present. The author contends that the field of future studies should not be left solely to states, corporations, or technologists and calls for the mainstreaming of the future, with social science playing a central role in understanding, debating, and shaping future visions.

The concept of "social futures" is introduced, drawing parallels with the idea of an "integral future." The author advocates for the inclusion of analyses of social institutions, practices, and lives in the theories and methods of potential futures. The text stresses that the time of the future is now, and social sciences should actively engage with it.

The discussion begins by highlighting the significance of social science in deconstructing the notion of "time." Different societies and institutions are noted to operate around contrasting time regimes, influencing people's lives. The historical shift from lived and experienced time to standardized and de-contextualized time is explored.

The text also delves into the idea that the future has often been perceived as empty and abstracted from context, making it susceptible to commodification and control. The transformation of the future's ownership from gods to people is discussed, with consequences for social life. The dangers of decontextualizing and depersonalizing the future are outlined, leading to potential exploitation without guilt or remorse.

Social science is credited with examining the pitfalls of extrapolating the future solely from the present. The importance of understanding various pasts and their interrelation with present and future events is emphasized. The concept of "futures literacy" is introduced as a means of using the future to question and unpack present assumptions.

The text discusses how social systems characterized by discontinuity, change, and unpredictability contribute to variations in time and anticipated futures. Concepts from complexity science and social studies of technology are applied to illustrate the unpredictable nature of futures, highlighting that technological innovations rarely follow linear processes.

Different perspectives on the future, ranging from utopian visions to dystopic scenarios, are explored. The text examines how futures are sometimes built into contemporary societies, such as the idea of developing "smart cities." The performative nature of future visions and the power dynamics involved in shaping the future are scrutinized.

The section concludes by examining the ownership of the future, questioning whether it is a private matter cared for by individuals or a shared, common future. The influence of large international corporations on the future is discussed, and the idea of the future as a monetized commodity is introduced. The text also touches on the corporate takeover of the world and the challenges posed by this trend, as highlighted by movements like Occupy the Future.

This section of the text emphasizes the widespread, fateful, and problematic nature of thinking and planning for futures. It addresses the challenges associated with ignoring social science research and concepts in the formulation of future visions, emphasizing the need to avoid both technological determinism and completely open futures. The author contends that the future is neither fully determined nor entirely open and advocates for a nuanced approach to planning futures.

The text introduces the idea that issues today are so significant and complex that there is a necessity for some form of planning for futures. However, the term "planning" is considered ideologically contaminated from the era of organized capitalism and social democracy. The text suggests that in contemporary disorganized capitalism, thinking about futures becomes a crucial way of involving the state and civil society in addressing major issues such as climate change.

The concept of "social futures" is proposed as a means of transcending both markets and technologies. Social futures involve the participation of various actors, including states and civil society, in shaping futures. The text introduces the idea of "post-modern planning" in the context of civil society, global change, wicked problems, and the limitations of markets.

The distinction between three types of futures—probable, possible, and preferable—is discussed, drawing on Wendell Bell's work. The text acknowledges that what is preferable may not be the most probable, and there is no guarantee that the most desirable future will be realized even if widely agreed upon.

The first part of the book is said to identify and chart various ways in which different entities have anticipated, described, imagined, and produced futures, including utopias and dystopias. The text mentions the examination of various future visions and models of society in the next chapter, with a focus on "past futures" that have contemporary resonance.

The second part of the book is described as turning to complexity thinking to navigate between determinism and openness. Complexity analyses are introduced, involving concepts such as path-dependence, lock-in, thresholds, positive feedback loops, tipping points, and phase transitions. The chapters explore the conditions for innovating new sociomaterial systems and assess methods for understanding different social futures.

In the third part, various methods and theories are applied to case studies of uncertain, contested, and socially powerful futures. Scenarios are developed, and the chapters assess the relative probabilities of different futures, drawing on complex systems thinking and backcasting.

The concluding chapter directs attention to the analyses of future analyses, emphasizing the need for plausible futures to be analytically embedded within multiple social institutions, practices, and movements. Complexity thinking is proposed to examine futures consisting of unstable, complex, and interdependent adaptive systems. The chapter underscores the importance of interdisciplinary research and highlights the unintended, perverse, and wicked problems that arise in examining, making, and assessing multiple futures.

The concluding section of the text reflects on the challenges and importance of developing expertise in thinking about the future, particularly social futures. It acknowledges the hazardous nature of long-term forecasting due to uncertainties and imponderables and emphasizes the need to peer into the future with the best available information, statistics, and models.

The author emphasizes the paradoxical nature of thinking about futures: while it is necessary for operating in the world and developing policies, forecasting the future is inherently uncertain and subject to numerous unknowns. The text draws attention to the complexities of anticipating and planning for future scenarios, including the presence of known and unknown unknowns.

The book is described as exploring various aspects of imagining social futures, embedding them within analyses of multiple social institutions, practices, and movements. It underscores the understanding that outcomes are not necessarily predetermined, and certain futures are not inevitable.

The first part of the book is summarized as documenting a range of anticipated futures, including past trends and recent trends like the "new catastrophism." The text highlights the unintended, perverse, and wicked problems that arise in a world of contested futures, including the potential collapse of societies.

The second part of the book, centered on complexity thinking, is described as examining the implications of complex systems for analyzing contested and uncertain social futures. It addresses the dynamics of powerful but fragile systems, emphasizing their innovation, unpredictability, and potential for reversal.

The third part of the book applies complex systems thinking to case studies involving 3D printing, urban mobility, and high-carbon systems. The text mentions that the exploration of varied futures demonstrates their connection to the power of social actors in shaping or "having" a future.

The conclusion highlights the contested nature of futures and their saturation with diverse interests. The text discusses how certain futures are almost literally owned by private interests rather than shared across societies. It reclaims the terrain of future studies for social science and progressive forces, aiming to mainstream the future into social science discourse.

The conclusion emphasizes the importance of analyzing social movements, institutions, practices, and lives to examine potential futures. It argues that power should be viewed significantly as a matter of uneven future-making. The text concludes by asserting that futures are never simple predictions or smooth extrapolations and that there is no empty future waiting to be filled. The knowledge of the future requires an understanding of various pasts and their trajectories, and the text concludes by discussing how innovations often involve unpredicted combinations of past elements.

This final section underscores the importance of recognizing distinctions between various types of futures – the probable, the possible, and the preferable. It emphasizes that what is preferable is not necessarily the most probable, and preferred futures may not align with the outcomes that actually emerge. The text highlights instances where once a particular future trajectory is set, it becomes challenging to deviate from it, leading to path-dependent patterns that may lead to undesirable outcomes.

The passage also discusses the various methods employed to envision futures, acknowledging the influence of history and embedded power relations on the possibilities for future-making. It addresses the significance of developing utopias that illustrate alternative possibilities and guide the way towards desirable futures, particularly focusing on car-free cities and transitioning to a low-carbon world.

Furthermore, the text suggests that thinking about futures is a means of reintroducing planning for the future but in a new context. It argues that issues in the contemporary era, such as global challenges, necessitate coordination among individuals, communities, corporations, states, and international organizations. This coordination becomes essential due to the potential failures of the future that markets can generate. The text acknowledges that traditional planning concepts have been critiqued from various ideological perspectives, but it contends that anticipating futures is crucial, and public bodies often play a central role in this process.

The author proposes that futures thinking is a way of bringing the state and civil society back into the forefront, especially when the focus is on social rather than technological futures. Social futures, in this context, challenge both autonomous market forces and the endogenous development of technologies. The text suggests that thinking about social futures authorizes a wide range of actors to be centrally involved in shaping future developments. This approach enables coordination in an era marked by civil society dynamics, global change, wicked problems, and the limitations of markets.

The passage concludes by emphasizing that thinking and practice should extend beyond market mechanisms, minimal states, and presumed technological inevitabilities. It proposes that while a fully planned future may not be feasible, a coordinated one might be the most viable option. This requires the mobilization of social futures thinking, with a key concern being the development of democratic futures thinking and practice. The text advocates for reclaiming the terrain of future studies for social science and social actors, highlighting the relevance of theory and research in disentangling, debating, and delivering social futures. It concludes by acknowledging the murky nature of the futures world but asserts the necessity of engaging with it, interrogating it, and potentially reshaping it in the ongoing analyses of social life in the new century.
