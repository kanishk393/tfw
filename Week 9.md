The text describes the emergence and evolution of Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online labor market that introduced the concept of "ghost work." Ghost work refers to the hidden human labor behind the scenes, often involving small and repetitive tasks that are crucial for various online platforms and services. The narrative begins with Amazon's need to clean up its product listings and reviews in the early 2000s, which led to the hiring of temporary workers.

To address the growing demand for labor in tasks such as verifying product descriptions, matching images, and improving customer reviews, Amazon created MTurk in 2005. MTurk allowed "requesters" to post tasks, and registered workers could complete these tasks for pay. The platform automated the hiring and payment processes, making it a convenient way for companies and individuals to access a global pool of workers for diverse tasks.

MTurk's significance lies in its role as an on-demand labor market powered by application programming interfaces (APIs). API access enabled software developers to integrate tasks into the MTurk platform seamlessly. This integration allowed humans to execute parts of the code, marking a departure from traditional programming where only machines executed code.

The text emphasizes that MTurk's innovation transformed the basic technology of task batching into a labor market where human labor could be bought and sold. The APIs served as a bridge between programmers and workers, essentially acting as managers of an on-demand contingent workforce. This new way of working disrupted traditional employment structures, with programmers and companies becoming "requesters" rather than employers.

The API-driven interaction between programmers and workers introduced a level of abstraction, where workers were represented by unique identifiers rather than being recognized as individuals with beliefs, attributes, and experiences. This abstraction, facilitated by the API, raised concerns about overlooking the human aspect of labor and its impact on people's lives.

The text concludes by drawing a parallel between MTurk and the historical Mechanical Turk chess automaton, highlighting that both involve human intelligence in the loop, contributing to the advancement of artificial intelligence. The reference to poker chips emphasizes how the abstraction of workers into unique identifiers can lead to a detachment from the human implications of the code and its effects on individuals. Overall, the emergence of MTurk and ghost work has played a significant role in automating small and large tasks, fueling the growth of online platforms and services.
