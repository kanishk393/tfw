### Introduction

The introduction sets the stage for exploring the dilemmas and transformations arising from the integration of smart machines, particularly computer-based technologies, into the workplace. It begins with a quote emphasizing the intertwined nature of human and technological history.

### The Scene at Piney Wood

The narrative unfolds at Piney Wood, a large pulp mill undergoing modernization. Workers express a mix of awe and apprehension toward the power of new technology. The looming uncertainty revolves around the future of their roles in the face of rapid technological changes.

### Workers' Concerns and Forecasts

The workers engage in a discussion about the potential impact of technology on their work lives. Concerns include job displacement, loss of knowledge, and societal challenges. Despite acknowledging the necessity of embracing technology for competitiveness, they foresee challenges such as stress, job insecurity, and the need for adaptability.

### Societal Implications

A woman worker raises broader societal concerns about widespread automation, questioning the consequences of job loss on tax revenue and the fabric of the transformed society. This perspective adds a layer to the discussion, moving beyond individual workplaces to the societal level.

### Three Key Choices for the Future

The introduction concludes by presenting three key choices that will shape the future:

1. **Conception and Distribution of Knowledge:** Examining how knowledge is conceived and distributed in the workplace amid technological changes.
   
2. **Relations of Authority in the Workplace:** Considering the impact of technology on power dynamics in the workplace and how relationships between managers and workers evolve.

3. **Techniques of Administration:** Exploring how the psychological ambience and communicative behavior in the workplace are shaped by the techniques of administration in the era of smart machines.

### Technology's Dual Nature

The text introduces the concept of the dual nature of information technology. It can both automate tasks and generate new streams of information, creating a profound impact on the transparency of organizational activities.

### Conclusion

The author emphasizes that the book aims to understand the deep structure of choices regarding technology integration. It poses contrasting scenarios for the future, ranging from a potential loss of human agency to the creation of a more harmonious and participatory work environment. The underlying theme is that technology, particularly information technology, is not neutral; it both automates tasks and generates new streams of information, ushering in a complex and transformative era.

### Part 1: Dilemmas of Knowledge Transformation

#### Information Technology's Dual Capacity
The section explores the concept of "informate" as a unique capacity of information technology, wherein activities, events, and objects are translated into and made visible by information. It emphasizes how intelligent technology's informating power supersedes traditional automation logic.

#### Manufacturing and Office Environments
Examines the informating power in manufacturing and office environments, illustrating how microprocessor-based devices and online systems transform three-dimensional processes into digitized data. The resulting data not only guide operations but also make the production process visible.

#### Automation and Informating
Explores the dual capacities of information technologyâ€”automation and informating. Discusses how automation alone perpetuates the logic of industrial machines, while informating introduces new dynamics that reconfigure work and social relationships.

#### Unintended Consequences and Leadership
Highlights the often overlooked informating capacity of information technology, emphasizing that its effects are not planned. Raises questions about leadership and the need for recognizing and exploiting the informating potential for organizational benefits.

### Part 2: Dilemmas of Authority

#### Historical Evolution of Managerial Authority
Traces the historical evolution of managerial authority, setting the stage for examining how the demands for intellective skills blur traditional operational and managerial distinctions.

#### Resistance to Change in Mills
Uses examples from pulp mills to illustrate attempts to resist change and maintain traditional managerial hierarchies in the face of evolving roles and authority relations.

#### Emerging Authority Relations
Despite resistance, explores how new roles and relations of authority begin to take shape in the mills, reflecting the changing demands of the computerized workplace.

### Part 3: Techniques of Control

#### Attempts to Shore Up Authority
Examines attempts to reinforce threatened authority relations through new control techniques, leveraging technology's visibility of organizational processes. Illustrates how managers turn to technology for shaping subordinates' behavior.

#### Weakening of Managerial Authority
Ironically discusses how efforts to strengthen managerial authority through technological control techniques may lead to a more profound weakening of authority within organizations.

### Conclusion: Portrait of an Informated Workplace

#### Managerial Efforts and Vision
Concludes with a hypothetical vision of an informated workplace, emphasizing the need for managerial efforts to embrace the challenges of the historical moment. Offers guidance, landmarks, and potential pitfalls for navigating the transformative era.
