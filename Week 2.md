**Point 1: The Annus Mirabilis of 1769 - Donald Cardwell's Perspective**
- Donald Cardwell referred to 1769 as the symbolic beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
- In this year, Richard Arkwright and James Watt patented their defining inventions.

**Point 2: The Origins of the Industrial Revolution and the Factory System**
- The roots of the Industrial Revolution extend further back and align with the evolution of the factory system.
- The precise emergence of the factory system is uncertain but was first defined by Andrew Ure in 1835 as the combined operations of various workpeople managing productive machines powered by a central source.
- The first legal definition dates from 1844, encompassing buildings where mechanical power is used to operate machinery.

**Point 3: Transition from Earlier Modes of Production**
- Before the rise of factories, the domestic system was predominant in Britain during the early eighteenth century.
- This system involved artisans living in cottages with limited space and simple labor organization within families.
- Artisan masters controlled production and didn't rely on financiers since they owned raw materials and tools.
- Output growth in domestic industry was gradual but steady, with merchants acting as intermediaries.

**Point 4: Transformation to Merchant Manufacturers**
- As markets integrated, merchants became indispensable middlemen, assisting artisans in selling their products.
- Merchants needed to be involved in finishing goods before selling, leading to the emergence of merchant manufacturers.
- Workers, once independent contractors in the countryside, increasingly depended on merchant manufacturers for livelihoods.

**Point 5: Gradual Loss of Ownership and Autonomy**
- The shift from independent contractors to employed workers in towns marked the gradual loss of ownership of the means of production.
- This transition contributed to the creation of a working class, as described by Karl Marx.
- The process of industrialization, characterized by the divorce between capital and labor, began in the late seventeenth century and spread across the country.

**Point 6: Factors Leading to the Emergence of the Factory System**
- The rise of international trade and competition among nation-states increased the need for mechanization.
- Growing wages necessitated mechanization to remain competitive in trade.
- Manufacturers had the financial means to adopt expensive machines, feasible primarily in factory settings.
- Some equipment, such as steam engines and iron-puddling furnaces, required large plants not suitable for workers' cottages.
- The development of the factory system was a technological evolution driven by economic and political incentives to mechanize.

**Point 7: Earlier Instances of Factories**
- Although the arrival of the factory system is typically dated to the late 1760s, earlier factories existed, such as the silk factory in Derby by 1718, employing around three hundred workers in a five-story building.

The text was authored by Donald Cardwell and includes references to Andrew Ure and the economic historian Paul Mantoux.

**Point 1: The Origin of the British Silk Industry**
- The British silk industry began when skilled workers from France settled in the outskirts of London after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.
- In its early days, the British silk industry faced challenges due to cheap imported silk brought in by smugglers.
- High wages in Britain made it difficult for domestic manufacturers to compete.

**Point 2: John Lombe's Espionage and Silk Throwing Machines**
- John Lombe embarked on a risky journey to Italy in 1716 to discover the secrets of silk-throwing machines.
- With the help of an Italian priest, Lombe gained access to these machines and secretly made drawings.
- He returned to Britain a year later and, with his brother Thomas, set up the first silk factory near Derby based on the Italian drawings.
- Thomas Lombe profited from this industrial espionage and received a knighthood for his contributions.

**Point 3: The Significance of the Early Silk Factories**
- The silk factories established in Derby and Stockport were considered impressive but too small to significantly impact the overall economy.
- They were "giants in an age of pygmies."

**Point 4: The Rise of the Cotton Industry**
- While the silk industry marked early developments, the true beginnings of the Industrial Revolution were seen in cotton.
- By 1830, the cotton industry became the largest in Britain, accounting for up to 8 percent of the GDP.
- Industrial centers like Manchester emerged as a consequence of its expansion.
- British cotton manufactures outcompeted China and India, the leading cotton producers in the seventeenth century.
- Initially, Britain struggled due to cheaper labor in Asia, but this cost disadvantage eventually drove efforts to mechanize production.

**Point 5: Mechanization of Cotton Spinning**
- Cotton spinning was a labor-intensive process before the advent of machines.
- The three stages of cotton yarn manufacturing involved opening raw cotton, carding, and spinning.
- Mechanization of each stage took place in factory settings.
- Richard Arkwright played a significant role in the mechanization of the cotton industry with the second Cromford mill, opened in 1776.

**Point 6: Earlier Attempts at Mechanization**
- Lewis Paul and John Wyatt had developed a promising system of roller spinning in the 1740s and 1750s.
- Wyatt recognized the potential of the factory system but failed to make it work practically.
- Worker-replacing technologies were not universally accepted, and some workers opposed them.
- Wyatt argued that such technologies would ultimately benefit Britain as a whole, but his roller spinning system did not succeed in enriching him or his companion.

The text references authors such as John Lombe, Thomas Lombe, Arkwright, Lewis Paul, John Wyatt, and Edward Cave.

**Point 1: Arkwright's Achievements and the Purpose of Innovations**
- Richard Arkwright's success was not solely based on brilliant innovation but rather overcoming engineering challenges to make roller spinning practical.
- Eighteenth-century British inventions were primarily aimed at cutting labor costs in production.
- Arkwright's water frame and carding machine significantly reduced labor costs in spinning and coarse cotton production.
- Challenges to the novelty of his inventions led to patent disputes.

**Point 2: James Hargreaves's Spinning Jenny**
- James Hargreaves developed the spinning jenny, a simple rectangular frame with vertical spindles.
- The spinning jenny allowed a single worker to spin multiple threads simultaneously, increasing efficiency.
- While more expensive than a spinning wheel, it was still cost-effective and space-efficient, not requiring a factory setting.
- The spinning jenny's easy integration into existing production processes contributed to its rapid adoption.

**Point 3: The Indirect Impact on the Factory System**
- Samuel Crompton further improved the spinning jenny to create the Crompton mule in 1779, combining features of Hargreaves' and Arkwright's machines.
- The Crompton mule was initially used in domestic industry but later applied in factory settings.
- The transition from spinning wheels to spinning machines led to resistance from workers, with incidents of machinery destruction.

**Point 4: Workers' Resistance and Changing Claims by Inventors**
- Inventors in the early eighteenth century rarely claimed that their innovations saved labor, likely to avoid publicizing adverse effects on local employment.
- They often promised employment creation for women and children.
- Over time, it became more acceptable to claim that inventions replaced labor, particularly the labor of skilled adults.
- Inventions were marketed as reducing the need for strength or skill, facilitating the substitution of unskilled workers for skilled ones.

**Point 5: Impact on Labor Costs and Labor Force**
- Spinning machines did save labor costs and replaced hand spinners.
- Early spinning machines were designed to be operated by children, which reduced labor expenses.
- Manufacturers benefited from gaining greater control over the factory workforce, especially when employing children as pauper apprentices.
- The employment of children was a way to control a large workforce with little bargaining power and enforce factory discipline.

The text discusses inventors like Richard Arkwright, James Hargreaves, and Samuel Crompton and their contributions to the industrialization of spinning. It also highlights the shift in claims made by inventors over time regarding the impact of their inventions on labor.

**Point 1: Introduction of the Power Loom**
- While spinning was mechanized and turned into a factory system in the late eighteenth century, weaving was still done with hand looms in domestic settings.
- Concern arose that after Richard Arkwright's patent expired, there would be an excess of spinning mills producing cotton, but not enough capacity to weave it into fabric.
- Reverend Edmund Cartwright took on the challenge of mechanizing weaving to prove that weaving mills were achievable.

**Point 2: Edmund Cartwright's Invention**
- Cartwright, a former Oxford student with a literary background, invested time and resources into constructing the power loom.
- He worked with a carpenter and a blacksmith to create the power loom.
- Together with the Grimshaw brothers, Cartwright established a factory with four hundred steam-powered looms.
- Weavers, fearing job loss, burned down the factory in protest.

**Point 3: Government Support and Innovation**
- During the reign of Elizabeth I, Cartwright's invention might have been banned due to potential social unrest.
- However, British governments of this time generally supported innovators rather than banning their inventions.
- The government provided funding for Cartwright's power loom after he petitioned Parliament for a grant in 1809, citing the importance of his machines for Britain's competitiveness in trade.

**Point 4: Impact of the Power Loom**
- The power loom was a significant invention, and as it improved in the nineteenth century, productivity increased significantly.
- James Bessen, an economic historian, calculated that in 1800, it took nearly forty minutes for a hand-loom weaver to produce a yard of coarse cloth, while in 1902, a weaver using eighteen automatic power looms could produce the same amount in less than a minute.
- However, the introduction of power looms came at the expense of hand-loom weavers, whose fate will be discussed further in chapter 5.
- The power loom marked the near completion of textile mechanization.

This passage highlights the introduction of the power loom as a significant innovation in weaving and its impact on the textile industry, including the challenges faced by hand-loom weavers.

**Point 1: Steam Power and the Industrial Revolution**
- Steam power played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution.
- Its advantages included mobility, urban application, and versatility across industries.
- Steam engines were considered a general-purpose technology, similar to computers and electricity in later eras.

**Point 2: The Origin of Steam Power**
- Steam power emerged from the scientific revolution and was initially used for pumping in mining and other purposes.
- Thomas Savery developed the early steam engine, known as the fire engine, for draining mines, but it had limitations.
- Thomas Newcomen's engine replaced the fire engine but also had limitations, primarily used in coal mining and places with cheap coal.
- James Watt's separate condensation chamber made steam power economically viable and versatile.
- Watt's steam engine found applications in various industries, including cotton production, spinning mills, sawmills, and mining.

**Point 3: Limited Early Economic Impact**
- The immediate macroeconomic impact of steam power was limited before 1800.
- Steam engines were adopted slowly, and water power remained cheaper for a long time.
- By the 1840s, steam engines became economically viable as fuel consumption dropped.

**Point 4: The Impact of Steam on Transportation**
- The steam engine revolutionized transportation in the mid-nineteenth century.
- Before railroads, the Industrial Revolution was mostly local, with improved roads and stagecoach technology.
- Railroads significantly improved travel speed, making long-distance travel accessible to more people.
- Iron played a crucial role in the construction of factories, steam engines, machinery, bridges, and rails.
- Abraham Darby's method of producing pig iron with coke made steam engines more energy-efficient and contributed to the development of railroads.

**Point 5: The Development of Steam-Powered Railroads**
- The completion of the journey toward steam-powered passenger rail travel took several decades.
- The first passenger railroad opened in 1805, but carriages were initially drawn by horses.
- Richard Trevithick's work on steam engines and George Stephenson's creation of the Rocket steam locomotive were essential in the development of fully steam-powered railroads.

This passage provides insight into the evolution and impact of steam power on the Industrial Revolution and transportation, particularly the development of railroads.

**Point 1: Opening Day of the Liverpool-Manchester Railway (1830)**
- The opening day of the Liverpool-Manchester Railway in 1830 was a significant public event attended by prominent figures, including Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington.
- William Huskisson, a former cabinet minister and member of Parliament for Liverpool, left the train during a scheduled stop to approach Wellington's carriage, leading to a tragic accident as he stumbled on the tracks and was fatally injured.

**Point 2: Impact of the Accident on Railroads**
- The tragic incident involving William Huskisson did not deter the enthusiasm for railroads; the railroad frenzy continued to grow.
- The railroad network in Britain expanded significantly, covering 6,200 miles by 1850 and 15,600 miles by 1880.
- Railroads played a crucial role in expanding people's horizons, facilitating travel, communication, and the exchange of ideas, and enabling workers to seek better job opportunities.

**Point 3: Railroad's Contribution to Growth**
- Economic historians have estimated the contribution of the railroad to aggregate growth using the concept of social savings.
- Railroads accounted for a substantial portion of GDP, with freight and passenger travel both contributing to economic benefits.
- Passenger travel savings accounted for an increasing share of GDP, especially when considering time savings.
- The full benefits of the Industrial Revolution, including those brought by railroads, took more than a century to be fully realized.

**Point 4: Acceleration of Industrial Change**
- Some places and industries experienced the accelerating pace of industrial change earlier than others.
- The expansion of certain industries had an effect on aggregate statistics after 1800.
- The impact of industry and technological advancements was especially evident in places like Manchester, known for its cotton manufacturing.

This passage highlights the transformative impact of railroads on transportation, economic growth, and societal changes during the 19th century, while also emphasizing the gradual realization of the benefits of the Industrial Revolution.

**CHAPTER 5**

**Point 1: Technological Advancements and Diverging Views**
- In the mid-19th century, technological advancements, especially in machinery and steam technology, were transforming industrial cities like Manchester.
- While some were impressed by these technological capabilities and saw it as progress, others had concerns about the impact on the working class.

**Point 2: Friedrich Engels' Perspective**
- Friedrich Engels, during his stay in Manchester, expressed a viewpoint that machines served to reduce the incomes of ordinary people while benefiting industrialists.
- He believed that the English middle classes, including industrialists, tended to ignore the suffering and distress of the working class.

**Point 3: Differing Attitudes toward Progress**
- The middle and upper classes were generally optimistic about technological progress, considering it a revelation.
- In contrast, the working poor, especially those affected negatively by machines, were more critical and fearful of unemployment.

**Point 4: Living Conditions and Wages**
- The conditions of the working class did not improve before the 1840s, and in many cases, living standards deteriorated.
- In rapidly growing industrial cities like Manchester and Glasgow, life expectancy at birth was much shorter than the national average.
- Despite the growth in output during the Industrial Revolution, wages did not increase proportionally. Real weekly wages only rose by a small percentage.
- When accounting for the increased working hours, it is suggested that hourly earnings declined in real terms for many workers.

**Point 5: Distribution of Gains**
- The gains from the Industrial Revolution primarily benefited the pioneers of industry, leading to a doubling of profit rates and an increase in the income share of the top 5 percent.

**Point 6: Impact on Consumption and Material Standards**
- Consumption patterns changed, with households reducing their expenditures on non-essential manufactured goods.
- Growing inequality in consumption was observed, with middle-class households increasingly able to afford non-essential goods while some factory workers and farmers struggled to do so.
- Biological indicators, such as adult heights, suggested that overall material living standards declined, with cohorts born in the early 1850s being shorter than those born earlier in the century.

This passage illustrates the complex and uneven effects of industrialization on different segments of society, highlighting the concerns and disparities in living standards and wages during this period.

This passage discusses the relationship between declining biological indicators of material standards, public health, and the causes of poor health during the Industrial Revolution. Here are the key points:

**Point 1: Public Health Debate**
- Public health was a major concern during the Industrial Revolution, with different perspectives on its causes.
- Edwin Chadwick believed that public health issues were primarily environmental, related to unhealthy living conditions in industrial towns.
- William Alison, on the other hand, argued that low wages, unemployment, and poor nutrition were critical factors contributing to poor public health.

**Point 2: Impact of Industrialization on Living Conditions**
- Industrialization led to the rise of overcrowded and unhealthy urban centers as people moved from rural areas to industrial towns.
- The "urban penalty" refers to the negative consequences of living in these industrial towns, including lower life expectancy.

**Point 3: Disease Environment**
- Vaccination against diseases like smallpox was a significant change in the disease environment during this period.
- The environmental perspective does not fully account for the decline in nutrition and stature among ordinary citizens.

**Point 4: Income Inequality and Poor Nutrition**
- Lower incomes contributed to poorer nutrition and shorter stature for many people, even as incomes grew on average.
- Rising inequality and increasing real food prices led to dietary changes, including a shift away from essential food items to non-essential items.
- The decline in nutritional status was associated with increased mortality and morbidity.

**Point 5: American Industrialization**
- Similar trends in declining nutritional status and health were observed in America during its industrialization.
- The decline in average physical stature was linked to rapid population growth, urbanization, and industrialization.
- Rising inequality and higher real food prices were key drivers of these negative health outcomes.

Overall, the passage underscores the complex interplay of economic factors, public health, and living conditions during the Industrial Revolution, with both environmental and income-related factors contributing to poor health outcomes for many.

This passage explores the "machinery question" and the broader debate surrounding the "conditions of England question" during the Industrial Revolution. Here are the key points:

**Point 1: Concerns about Machines and Employment**
- The introduction of machines into various industries raised concerns about unemployment and the impact on workers' livelihoods.
- Early expressions of this concern can be traced back to the late 18th century when Sir Frederick Eden expressed worries about machines depriving the poor of employment.
- The use of machines in industries like wool spinning was believed to result in job losses for laborers.

**Point 2: Economists' Perspectives**
- David Ricardo, an economist, argued that machinery could indeed be detrimental to laborers' interests as it reduced the demand for manual labor.
- Ricardo's ideas prompted discussions about technological unemployment and the short-term challenges it posed.

**Point 3: Fear of Machines**
- Fear of machines and their impact on workers intensified in the 19th century.
- Victorian novelists like Charles Dickens and Elizabeth Gaskell captured the concerns of laborers toward machinery in their writings.
- Workers worried about the effects of machines on wages, dignity, morality, independence, and social status.
- Factory work was often depicted as repetitive and dehumanizing, with workers seen as enslaved to machines.

**Point 4: The "Conditions of England Question"**
- The machinery question became part of a broader debate known as the "conditions of England question," a term coined by Thomas Carlyle.
- Carlyle and other social reformers criticized industrialization, viewing machines as degrading workers.
- Some believed that the domestic system, where work was done at home, was superior to factory work in terms of preserving family life and moral values.
- Workers in the domestic system had more control over their work hours and conditions, unlike those in factories.

**Point 5: Factory Work and the Loss of Freedom**
- Factory work was often perceived as prison-like, with enforced hours and a lack of personal freedom.
- The factory system created a new type of worker accustomed to strict adherence to the clock, which contrasted with the more flexible and family-oriented domestic system.

Overall, the passage illustrates the deep-seated concerns and criticisms surrounding the impact of machinery and factory work on the lives and well-being of workers during the Industrial Revolution.

This passage discusses the perspectives of various individuals during the Industrial Revolution regarding the impact of machinery and technology on employment and society. Here are the key points:

**Point 1: Fear of Automation**
- Similar to contemporary concerns about the future of artificial intelligence, people during the Industrial Revolution worried about the potential harm caused by technology.
- Elizabeth Gaskell, in particular, believed that automation and machinery could lead to a future where production would be almost entirely automated, potentially causing severe unemployment.

**Point 2: The Debate on Machinery**
- The debate on machinery and automation was not settled, and critics like Gaskell inspired others, including Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx, to ponder the conditions of the working classes and the impact of the factory system on them.
- Marx, in his work "Das Kapital," argued that machinery created redundancies in labor, leading to wage reductions, especially in England.

**Point 3: Defenders of Mechanization**
- There were also defenders of mechanization, including Charles Babbage, Andrew Ure, and Edward Baines.
- Babbage presented machines as a complement to human labor, making work more efficient and productive.
- Ure argued that machines were essential for creating new and better-paying jobs, enabling workers to advance economically.

**Point 4: Different Perspectives**
- The perspectives on machinery varied widely, with critics fearing its consequences, defenders seeing it as a source of progress, and data suggesting that the impact on workers' wages and living standards was complex.
- Baines, for example, believed that workers employed alongside machinery were well-remunerated, but he acknowledged challenges faced by workers who were replaced by machines, such as hand-loom weavers.

Overall, this passage illustrates the diversity of views and debates surrounding the role of machinery in the Industrial Revolution, similar to contemporary discussions about the impact of automation and artificial intelligence on employment and society.

This passage delves into the economic and social consequences of mechanization and the rise of factories during the Industrial Revolution. Here are the key points:

**Point 1: Impact on Employment**
- Mechanization, particularly in the textile industry, led to the displacement of traditional handcraft workers, such as hand spinners and hand-loom weavers.
- The decline of hand spinning in the late 18th century and the rise of mechanization in weaving led to prolonged economic struggles for rural households as employment opportunities dried up.
- Hand-loom weavers, once considered skilled artisans, faced reduced earning potential and wage inequality as power looms became widespread.

**Point 2: Personal Tragedies**
- Researchers like Jane Humphries and Benjamin Schneider have highlighted the personal tragedies suffered by individuals and families due to the disappearance of hand trades.
- Autobiographies from the period provide vivid descriptions of the challenges faced by those affected by mechanization.

**Point 3: Unemployment**
- Unemployment was a significant concern during this period, but it had multiple causes, including economic downturns. The extent to which unemployment was solely due to mechanization is difficult to determine.
- Estimates by John Fielden in 1833 suggest an unemployment rate of around 9 percent among hand-loom weavers in certain regions.

**Point 4: Worker Mobility**
- Around 1850, only a quarter of adults in major industrial cities were born there, indicating significant worker mobility.
- Younger and more able workers were more mobile, while older workers tended to remain tied to their location and occupation, often in nearby areas.

**Point 5: Child Labor**
- Factory owners preferred child labor for its cost-effectiveness and greater discipline.
- Children constituted a significant portion of the workforce in industries like textiles and coal mining.
- Children worked long hours, often up to eighteen hours a day, and were subjected to shift work to maximize factory productivity.

This passage provides insight into the complex economic and social dynamics of the Industrial Revolution, including the hardships faced by displaced workers and the prevalence of child labor in factories.

This passage explores the harsh working conditions and challenges faced by workers during the Industrial Revolution. Here are the key points:

**Point 1: Corporal Punishment**
- Factory discipline during the Industrial Revolution was enforced through the threat of corporal punishment. Although extreme cases of child abuse were not the norm, many children did suffer physical mistreatment.
- Some factory owners, such as Ellice Needham at Litton Mill, engaged in abusive practices like pinching children's ears, hitting, kicking, and other forms of physical harm.

**Point 2: Treatment of Adult Workers**
- Adult workers were primarily concerned with the threat to their incomes due to mechanization and factory work.
- Transitioning to new jobs was challenging, often requiring workers to move to different locations and acquire new skills.
- The loss of traditional trades and the pace of technological change made it difficult for workers to keep up with the evolving job market.

**Point 3: Unemployment**
- Unemployment was a concern for workers, and the transition between different sectors of the economy could lead to temporary joblessness.
- Workers had to rely on their savings during periods of unemployment, as government-sponsored unemployment insurance did not exist in Britain until 1911.

**Point 4: Worker Mobility**
- Workers faced demands for geographical and occupational mobility due to changing production processes and the need to adapt to technological progress.
- Mechanization often led to the introduction of cheaper and less skilled labor, putting pressure on existing workers.

- Some workers resisted mechanization and the changes brought about by industrialization. The passage mentions the Luddites as an example of worker opposition.
- The benefits of industrialization, such as new jobs and cheaper goods, were not immediately felt by workers, leading to discontent and resistance among those whose skills became redundant.

This passage provides insights into the difficult circumstances faced by workers during the Industrial Revolution, including issues of discipline, unemployment, mobility, and resistance to technological change.

This passage discusses the resistance and protests of workers known as the Luddites during the Industrial Revolution. Here are the key points:

**Point 1: Short-Term vs. Long-Term**
- The passage begins by highlighting the distinction between the short-term and long-term effects of the Industrial Revolution on workers.
- While the long-term benefits of industrialization included new goods and better-paying jobs, many workers in the short run lost their livelihoods and faced economic hardships.

**Point 2: Workers' Opposition to Machines**
- Workers whose skills became obsolete due to mechanization felt that machinery threatened their livelihoods and were inclined to oppose it.
- The passage questions why citizens would voluntarily participate in industrialization if it reduced their own well-being.
- The reduction in earning potential in traditional industries made factory jobs more attractive, even if they were seen as detrimental.

**Point 3: Clashes and Riots**
- Clashes and riots between workers and the British government over the adoption of machine technology were not uncommon.
- The passage mentions instances of steam-powered sawmills and factories being burned down by workers who believed that machines deprived them of employment.
- The British government responded to such riots with repression and passed an act in 1769 making the destruction of machines a felony punishable by death.

**Point 4: Political and Legal Resistance**
- Workers attempted to hinder the spread of machines through political means, such as petitions against various machines.
- However, these attempts to restrict machines failed as Parliament often sided with industrialists, emphasizing the importance of machines to trade and the country's competitiveness.

**Point 5: The Luddites**
- The passage introduces the Luddites, who were workers opposed to the mechanization of their industries.
- Luddite actions included smashing machines, particularly those that threatened jobs.
- Luddism began in the Midlands in 1811 and spread to other regions, with attacks on machines causing significant damage.

This passage illustrates the challenges and resistance faced by workers as they tried to cope with the changes brought about by industrialization and the adoption of machinery. The Luddites' actions serve as a prominent example of worker opposition during this period.

This passage provides further insights into the challenges faced by workers during the Industrial Revolution and the responses to these challenges. Here are the key points:

**Point 1: Government Response**
- The Luddites, like their predecessors, were ultimately unsuccessful in their efforts to prevent the spread of machines.
- The British government responded to the Luddite riots by deploying more troops, showing its determination to maintain industrial progress and international trade competitiveness.

**Point 2: Parliamentary Committee and Worker Distress**
- A Parliamentary committee heard petitions for relief from cotton workers during the Luddite riots in 1812.
- The committee's report acknowledged the great distress of workers but advocated against legislative interference in trade, prioritizing economic freedom over workers' welfare.
- Lord Liverpool, the prime minister at the time, believed that aiding redundant workers would impede their redeployment, which was seen as detrimental to the British economy.

**Point 3: Factors Contributing to Machinery Riots**
- The passage highlights that machinery riots during the Industrial Revolution were not solely driven by fear of displacement due to technological advances.
- Factors contributing to social unrest included economic downturns caused by war, trade disruptions, deteriorating incomes, long working hours, lack of suffrage, freedom, and dignity.
- Some riots were not just against the spread of machines but expressed dissatisfaction with the factory system as a whole.
- Workers at times targeted specific machines they believed were responsible for their hardships.

**Point 4: Captain Swing Riots**
- The Captain Swing riots in 1830 targeted agricultural machines, primarily threshing machines.
- The British government responded with a stern approach, sentencing some rioters to death, while others were deported.
- Newly compiled data on the diffusion of threshing machines suggests that worker-replacing technology was a key determinant of the probability of unrest, indicating that machines themselves were a significant cause of worker concerns.

Overall, the passage highlights the complex interplay of economic, social, and technological factors contributing to the machinery riots during the Industrial Revolution, with machines often being a central source of workers' grievances.

This passage discusses the economic dynamics and shifts in real wages during the Industrial Revolution, as well as the role of technological progress. Here are the key points:

**Point 1: Engels' Observation**
- Engels observed that industrialists "grow rich on the misery of the mass of wage earners," which accurately reflected the situation during the Industrial Revolution.

**Point 2: Challenge in Explaining Stagnant or Falling Real Wages**
- The passage acknowledges the challenge in economic theory of explaining stagnant or falling real wages alongside a growing economy.

**Point 3: Economic Models and Technology**
- Economists have developed models that explain how wages and the labor share of income can fall as technology progresses.
- This is relevant to understanding the Industrial Revolution, where technology often replaced labor in existing tasks.

**Point 4: Unequal Distribution of Gains**
- During the Industrial Revolution, the gains from technological progress were distributed unequally, with corporate profits primarily benefiting industrialists who reinvested them in factories and machines.

**Point 5: "Engels' Pause"**
- This period of unequal income distribution and stagnant wages is referred to as "Engels' pause," reflecting the time observed and described by Engels.

**Point 6: Shift in Capital and Labor Income**
- In the early decades of the 19th century, the profit share of national income doubled, while the shares of land and labor declined.
- Output grew much faster than wages during this classic period of the Industrial Revolution.

**Point 7: Compression of Labor and Capital Income**
- In contrast, in the period 1840–1900, there was a shift in the income distribution. Output per worker increased, and real wages grew even faster.
- There was a compression of income between labor and capital, with both laborers and the wealthy seeing substantial increases in their income.

**Point 8: Explanations for Rising Real Wages**
- The passage suggests that technological change became increasingly labor-augmenting rather than labor-replacing.
- The accumulation of human capital, including skills, knowledge, and abilities, became crucial for workers.
- Investment in human capital, such as education and training, contributed to rising real wages.

**Point 9: Shift in Technological Progress**
- Before the 1830s, technological progress primarily increased the demand for physical capital while often replacing workers.
- After the 1830s, technological progress led to a relative increase in the demand for human capital, contributing to rising wages.

Overall, the passage provides insights into the economic dynamics of the Industrial Revolution, including income distribution, technological progress, and the shift from labor-replacing to labor-augmenting technologies.

This passage discusses the factors contributing to the long absence of human capital accumulation during the early days of the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent shift in the demand for human capital. Here are the key points:

**Point 1: Little Demand for Human Capital Early On**
- In the early days of the Industrial Revolution, there was little demand for formal education or human capital.
- Many industrial jobs did not require literacy or formal education, and workers could acquire skills through on-the-job training.

**Point 2: Division of Labor in Factories**
- Early factories introduced a division of labor, where highly skilled workers performed the most difficult tasks, while unskilled laborers handled less complex work.
- The surge in child labor during this period reflects the view that factory jobs required less skill than artisan jobs.

**Point 3: Middle-Income Jobs Replaced**
- Middle-income artisan jobs were replaced by machine-tending children, which contributed to income inequality during this period.

**Point 4: Change in Demand for Human Capital**
- Over time, the demand for human capital increased as machines became more complex and required skilled operatives to operate them.

**Point 5: Child Labor Patterns**
- Child labor patterns show that during the early Industrial Revolution, a significant portion of the workforce consisted of children, but this pattern changed over time.

**Point 6: Impact of Factory Acts**
- The Factory Acts of the 1830s, which regulated working conditions and improved conditions for child laborers, may have increased the cost of child labor.
- This may have encouraged the adoption of steam power, which, in turn, required more skilled operatives.

**Point 7: Introduction of Steam Power**
- Steam power started to have a significant impact on growth in the 1830s, coinciding with the peak of child labor.
- The adoption of steam power and the arrival of larger machines increased the demand for skilled operatives.

**Point 8: Gradual Transition to Labor-Augmenting Technologies**
- The transition from labor-replacing to labor-augmenting technologies was gradual and likely began around the 1840s.
- Real wages started to grow after 1840, suggesting this transition.

**Point 9: Emergence of Skilled Occupations**
- As factories grew in size and number, new skilled occupations emerged, including managers, accountants, clerks, salespeople, and mechanical engineers.
- Skilled occupations contributed to the demand for human capital.

**Point 10: Contribution to Rising Wages**
- Rising wages after 1840 can be attributed to the creation of new jobs that required human capital and skills.
- The growth in skilled occupations and literacy rates played a role in increasing wages.

**Point 11: Role of Human Capital in Wages**
- Human capital, including skills and education, eventually became more valuable, and the skills acquired by workers were reflected in their wages.

The passage illustrates the changing dynamics of labor demand and human capital accumulation during the Industrial Revolution, emphasizing the shift from unskilled labor to skilled operatives and the subsequent impact on wages.

In conclusion, this passage highlights several key points regarding the impact of the British Industrial Revolution:

1. **Divergence Within Britain**: The Industrial Revolution not only marked a divergence between the Western world and the rest but also led to internal disparities within Britain itself. This period, often referred to as "Engels's pause," initially saw stagnant or declining living standards for many citizens.

2. **Benefits of Technological Progress**: It took several decades for the benefits of technological progress to reach common people. Initially, the gains from industrialization predominantly benefited capital owners.

3. **Political Factors**: In preindustrial times, monarchs sometimes hindered technological advancements to avoid political upheaval. However, by the eighteenth century, the industrial class had gained political influence. Political leaders prioritized the spread of machine technology to maintain Britain's competitive advantage, even if it came at the expense of workers.

4. **Competition and Erosion of Guild Power**: Growing competition among nation-states and the erosion of craft guilds' political power shifted the balance in favor of innovators and industrial pioneers, rather than workers.

5. **Coercion and Workers' Resistance**: While workers may have appeared to willingly accept the rise of factories despite the reduction in their well-being, this was often due to coercion. Mechanized factories displaced artisan workers, leading to the rage of many, including the Luddites. However, the lack of political power among these workers made their resistance futile.

6. **Long-Term Shift in Growth Pattern**: In the later stages of the Industrial Revolution, a new growth pattern emerged. As productivity increased with the adoption of steam power, real wages began to rise. This shift occurred largely without significant government intervention or organized labor movements.

7. **Shift from Labor-Replacing to Labor-Augmenting Technology**: Initially, technology took the form of capital that replaced skilled workers in existing tasks. For example, machine-tending children replaced middle-income workers. However, as technology advanced, it began to augment labor, increasing the value of workers' skills.

8. **Impact on Attitudes Toward Technology**: The change from technology that replaced workers to technology that enabled them marked the end of widespread resistance to machinery. People's attitudes toward technological change are influenced by whether they can expect to benefit from it.

Overall, the passage underscores the complex interplay of economic, political, and technological factors during the Industrial Revolution and its profound effects on both societal well-being and attitudes toward technological progress.
